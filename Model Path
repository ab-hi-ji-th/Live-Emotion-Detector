The model is larger than 300Mb and hence I had to host it on HuggingFace. Given below is the link for you to access the final trained model and use as per your discretion.

Download the final_model.pth because it contains the final trained weights of my Vision Transformer (ViT) model. 
This is the optimized model ready for inference and should be sufficient for anyone to use the emotion detection system without needing intermediate checkpoints.
